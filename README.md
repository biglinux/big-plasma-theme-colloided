## A Comprehensive Adwaita Theme Suite for Qt and KDE Plasma

In the wake of adwaita-qt's discontinuation, I embarked on a search for alternatives and stumbled upon [KvLibadwaita](https://github.com/GabePoel/KvLibadwaita), which has done a stellar job in crafting a Kvantum theme that mirrors the Adwaita theme's aesthetic for Qt applications.

Building upon KvLibadwaita, I've made several modifications and rebranded it as **BigAdwaitaRound**.

However, the quest didn't stop there. To align the window border theme, or the Kwin theme, with the Adwaita ambiance, I utilized the versatile and configurable [klassy](https://github.com/paulmcauley/klassy) and shared a preset that convincingly emulates the Adwaita theme.

The Plasma theme was the final piece of the puzzle. Drawing inspiration from how KvLibadwaita is a modification of the Colloid theme for Kvantum, I tweaked the Colloid Plasma theme. The modifications were minimal yet impactful, bringing it into closer harmony with Adwaita's look and feel. I also dialed down the transparency, opting for a non-blur theme approach to enhance performance.

For those interested in the complete Colloid theme for KDE Plasma, head over to [Colloid-kde](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Colloid-kde).

This suite aims to provide a cohesive and performance-friendly Adwaita experience across Qt and KDE Plasma environments.
